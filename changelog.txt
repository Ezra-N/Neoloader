	New Error Capture System
		Previous 'detected errors' (usually from faulty function input) returned false and an error string.
		This still occurs, but now there is an optional logging and dialog system trhough the API "lib.err_handle()"
		this affects ***__ALL__*** API functions
	
	new option: Do Error Popup
		Controls whether errors are presented to the user or only logged through the error capture system
	
	changed file resolving
		lib.resolve_file now accepts an optional second path argument
		lib.resolve_file no longer errors if no '/' is provided
	
	changed how plugins are loaded
		plugins distributed WITH other plugins may have variable folder structure; plugins now store their folder path during registry, and when activated, this path is attempted if all others fail (see changes to file resolving)
	
	changed how INI files are built into table objects
		fixed how dependencies are collected (used a negative iterator on accident)
		stores folder path of the INI file pointer provided
	
	fixed how plugins are registered
		Registry should be more robust to plugins with no provided version
			This is a bad practice to do, but won't crash Neoloader anymore
	
	changes to plugin activation
		fixes versionless activation to attempt the latest available like other API functions do
		activation now provides the plugin's INI folder path when resolving the plugin's file
		now logs where the activation system fails
	
	changes to plugin state retrieval
		Now includes the folder path
	
	changes to Neoloader global state retreival
		ifmgr now returns "vo-if" only if the current general interface manager doesn't exist; fixes issues where the current IF manager may check for itself being the active manager (as opposed to loaded but not active)
	
	fixed how plugins set their class
		Properly handles "version 0" as an attempt to set the latest version installed
			This is a bad practice to do, but won't crash Neoloader anymore
	
	fixed how plugins lock their class
		Properly handles "version 0" as an attempt to set the latest version installed
			This is a bad practice to do, but won't crash Neoloader anymore
		if a custom key isnt provided, now calls lib.generate_key (but doesn't store/return it, so consider that lock permanent!)
	
	fixed how plugins unlock their class
		Properly handles "version 0" as an attempt to set the latest version installed
			This is a bad practice to do, but won't crash Neoloader anymore
	
	fixed how plugins access their INIs
		converts header or key arguments to string, in case the provided value wasn't.
	
	New shortcut functions
		lib.get_path lets you retrieve a folder path without using lib.get_state and parsing the provided table
		lib.open_config will launch the currently active plugin management engine
		lib.open_if_config will launch the currently active interface management engine
	
	Overhauled the startup loader process
		there was no functional difference between a library and a plugin, and if a library were erroneously dependent on a plugin then it would never get loaded. Everything is (again) sorted into a single table for activation, ignoring classification.
		Added more logging
		now uses lib.resolve_file to launch the current interface management engine, if it exists (previously used a pcall setup)
		improved handling of plugins that don't have versioning information
			This is a bad practice, but will less likely cause crashes
		fixed a LOT of bugs related to forgetting which tables worked what way
	
	neomgr changes
		A plugin's public name now has a maximum visible length (1/5th of a user's screen)
