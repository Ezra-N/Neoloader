TO DO LIST:

Verify working state of everything on PC and mobile

Neoloader:
	
	Request startup settings on new install via blocking dialog
	
Neoloader-Documentation/Utilities:
	
	create new example of a manageable plugin that only executes at normal load time (instead of activation by Neoloader)
		useful for multi-file plugins that want to be cross compatible, or for automated converters
	
	Create auto-patcher application; make old plugins minimally compatible with the Neoloader system
		future idea, web platform that can do this via browser?
	
	Add lib.reload to documentation
	
reskin: 
	
	show the currently active skin (path if not registered, name if registered)
	
	fix recovery from menu locking flight input

neomgr:
	
	pluginlist
		on apply, re-open dialog after reload maybe?
	
	try low resolutions, different scaled interfaces, and more aspect ratios
		scaling probably affects the most. 
		at this point, is it better to try and manually set width/height of spacers after map and refresh?
			defaultUI style: put all elements in a list, map them, compare each to see max size. then, apply new size, append to iup.list. map list.
