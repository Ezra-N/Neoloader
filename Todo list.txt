TO DO LIST:

Verify working state of everything on PC and mobile

Neoloader:
	
	Investigate plugins remaining loaded after Reload()
		tied to not being garbage collected because they still are referenced in the /command table?
			potential fix: look for any registered commands that aren't base-game and not in the alias table, and unbind them
				--requires lib.reload
			secondary fix: if primary doesn't work, have plugins that can submit a list of commands to be manually unbound
				--still requires lib.reload
				--non-conforming plugins can't be guaranteed unloaded
	
	Implement new event PRE_RELOAD_INTERFACE and API lib.reload
		when the user runs /reload, or lib.reload is executed, this event is triggered first.
		At event end, Neoloader runs its own final cleanup, before triggering the proper ReloadInterface()
	
	Request startup settings on new install via blocking dialog
	
Neoloader-Documentation/Utilities:
	
	create new example of a manageable plugin that only executes at normal load time (instead of activation by Neoloader)
		useful for multi-file plugins that want to be cross compatible, or for automated converters
	
	Create auto-patcher application; make old plugins minimally compatible with the Neoloader system
		future idea, web platform that can do this via browser?
	
reskin: 
	
	show the currently active skin (path if not registered, name if registered)
	
	fix recovery from menu locking flight input

neomgr:
	
	pluginlist
		on apply, re-open dialog after reload maybe?
	
	figure better way to hide all and show HUD
	
	don't show notifications when in flight, instead just print()
		fixes notifications showing under HUD
	
	try low resolutions, different scaled interfaces, and more aspect ratios
		scaling probably affects the most. 
		at this point, is it better to try and manually set width/height of spacers after map and refresh?
