TO DO LIST:
	
	uninstall marks all plugins in the registry loadstate as off
		(implemented, make sure this works)
	
	sanitize internal references to this_naming_style and notThisType and notthistype and notTHIStype and definitely not THIS_NAMING_STYLE (although screaming snake case IS an epic name)

neomgr:

	pluginlist
		set max width on public name
		enable/disable all mods
	Logging
		Make log refresh button and update on export
	Settings
		place settings inside scrollbox
		
		Neoloader settings
			Default Load State=<dropdown NO|YES> //user changes if new plugins are auto-loaded next game launch
				users will likely just set this to "YES", but the default state is "NO" to encourage inspecting plugins (at minimum on a surface level, of what appears in the neomgr interface) before using them.
			Echo Neoloader system messages=<checkbox> //true, messages are also printed in addition to logged

			switch other options to using the dropdown system instead of a toggle
