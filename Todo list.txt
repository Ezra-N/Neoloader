TO DO LIST:
	
	uninstall marks all mods in the registry loadstate as off
		(implemented, make sure this works)
	
	sanitize internal references to this_naming_style and notThisType and notthistype and notTHIStype
	
	fix the IF-handler during Init; it checks for "load" state multiple times, and probably just needs to be rewritten for sanity
		check if this is eating a LOT of time during init; phase 3, which includes this, is the most costly part after new installation

	implement using the config_override properly; right now, it only affects the neo table, but nothing else.
		gkreadstr/gkreadint
	
	fix lib.resolvefile to halt if error during loadfile is not a file not found
		(implemented, make sure this works)

	make sure the if loader during init does its job
		we can use draugath's barebones_IF to check this
			todo: patch his files to work through Neoloader instead of a direct customIF


neomgr:
	
	make neomgr obey its set options
	
	Modlist
		set max width on public name
	Logging
		Make log refresh button and update on export
	Settings
		place settings inside scrollbox
		
		Neoloader settings
			Default Load State=<dropdown NO|YES> //user changes if new mods are auto-loaded next game launch
				users will likely just set this to "YES", but the default state is "NO" to encourage inspecting mods (at minimum on a surface level, of what appears in the neomgr interface) before using them.
			Echo Neoloader system messages=<checkbox> //true, messages are also printed in addition to logged
			
		neomgr settings
			Open neomgr on game launch=<checkbox>
			Show Notifications=<checkbox>
