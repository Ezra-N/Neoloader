TO DO LIST:
	
	sanitize internal references to this_naming_style and notThisType and notthistype and notTHIStype and definitely not THIS_NAMING_STYLE (although screaming snake case IS an epic name)
	
	change modreg references to pluginreg in all INIs and neoloader itself
	
	reskin: show the currently active skin (path if not registered, name if registered)

neomgr:
	
	move the neomgr access button in the OptionsDialog when angularUI is not active
	
	pluginlist
		on apply, re-open dialog after reload maybe?
	Logging
		Make log refresh button and update on export
	Settings
		place settings inside scrollbox
